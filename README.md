# HamShield

WARNING: The dev branch is not guaranteed to work. Please use caution if you choose to use that branch. 

All of the AFSK, DDS, etc. files have been moved to the in Progress directory. These files collectively use twice as much memory as the essential HamShield functions. The current plan is to make sure these are only included if they're going to be used. We'll also be adapting them to make them more friendly to non-Uno Arduinos. Stay tuned for those changes.

The master branch is intended for use with HamShield hardware -09 and above.

HamShield Arduino Library and Example Sketches

This repository is meant to be checked out into your Arduino application's libraries folder. After reloading the application, the library and example sketches should be available for use.
